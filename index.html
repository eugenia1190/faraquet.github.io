    <p>
        Hello, I'm Andrey Andriychuk, Software Engineer from Saint Petersburg. 

        During my career I worked with different Platforms and various Technologies, such as Software for Industry Automation for Windows and Embedded Systems. Development in Ruby was my main specialisation for last few years. I worked on several Ruby-based Highload Back-ends, Services and Rails-based websites of various size and complexity.
